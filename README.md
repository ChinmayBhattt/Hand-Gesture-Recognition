# 🖐️ **Hand Gesture Detector** 🚀

Welcome to the **Hand Gesture Detector** project! This innovative project utilizes **MediaPipe** and **Python** to recognize hand gestures in real time. The goal is to bring **touchless interaction** to everyday technologies, enabling users to control devices or applications using just their hands!

## 💡 **About the Project**
The **Hand Gesture Detector** is built to recognize and classify hand gestures using **MediaPipe's hand tracking** model. This opens up possibilities for creating touchless interfaces, applications for **sign language translation**, **gaming**, and even **augmented reality (AR)** experiences.

Key Features:  
- **Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition**: Detect and classify hand gestures instantly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to integrate with existing applications.
- **Powered by AI**: Leveraging **MediaPipe** for advanced hand keypoint tracking.
- **Multi-Purpose Applications**: From gaming and accessibility tools to virtual control systems.

## 🎯 **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **MediaPipe**: For real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For gesture classification (if applicable).

## 🔧 **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChinmayBhattt/Hand-Gesture-Recognition.git
   cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the app.py file:
```
   python app.py
```

# 📝 How It Works

Hand Tracking: The system uses MediaPipe's hand tracking model to locate key points on the user's hand.
Gesture Classification: Based on the detected key points, the system classifies the gesture into predefined categories.
Real-Time Feedback: The results are displayed immediately, allowing for seamless interaction.

# 🌍 Applications
Touchless Control Systems: Control devices without physically touching them.
Sign Language Translation: Helping bridge communication gaps for people with hearing impairments.
Interactive Gaming: Enabling gesture-based controls for immersive gaming experiences.
Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality: Enhancing user interaction in VR/AR environments.
